Elinor Clair Awan was born in Los Angeles, California in the United States, and grew up in a family of simple means. She studied political science at the University of California Los Angeles, where she also received her PhD in 1965. She later went on to work at Indiana University in Bloomington. Elinor Ostrom has also been affiliated with Arizona State University in Tempe and Virginia Tech. She married fellow political scientist Vincent Ostrom in 1963. Initially, she worked primarily on studying the role of public decisions and choices in the case of the production of useful goods and services. Later, Ostrom began to study the interaction of people with ecosystems in relation to providing a long-term scheme for maintaining a large 'crop yield' of useful resources. In 2009 Elinor Ostrom became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in economics. In October 2011, Ostrom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and it was from this disease that She died. Elinor Ostrom died on June 12, 2012.<br>

Ostrom challenged the view that there are only 2 management options for public property - public or private - and suggested paying attention to the 3rd option-collective.

Ostrom was awarded the accolade for her research analyzing economic governance, with a focus on managing finite resources, referred to as "commons," within a community. It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters, and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable. <br>
Elinor Ostrom demonstrated that common-pool resources can be effectively managed collectively, without government or private control.  <br> </p1>
