 </h1>
<p1> I wrote this site in HTML and using the CSS style language. To begin with, I presented what the project will look like. I used photoshop to make a draft. I decided to implement the site in the form of blocks. Specified the size of the blocks, their color, and location on the page. Further, in each block I added the portraits of the scientists and made in between the intervals. I made a frame for each photo and added a separator between the blocks. I found the background on the Internet and installed it on the start page. I downloaded a special font for the title and installed it. When you click on the portrait of a scientist, you go to the page about him. Here I also designed text, blocks, and headings.</p1>
