<p1> Sometimes an old idea needs a new champion. Keynesian economics, despite having achieved the status of intellectual orthodoxy in the first half of the 20th century and still retaining it, has come under fire numerous times from New Classical Economics. Consequently, proponents of Keynes like MIT-trained Joseph Stiglitz have responded by defending the updated versions of the theory.

Stiglitz has done this in numerous ways, but perhaps the most obvious includes his development of a new branch of economics called "The Economics of Information." This field studies information asymmetries and develops novel ideas like adverse selection and moral hazard. Much of this work led to him receiving the Noble Prize in economics in 2001. Furthermore, he acted as the lead author of the 1995 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which received the Noble Peace Prize in 2007.

He has been given over 40 honorary doctorates. The New York Times listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He was chief economist of the World Bank from 1997-2000 before Janet Yellen succeeded him. He now serves on various prestigious boards such as the Acumen Fund and Resources for the Future.
Stiglitz worked with the National Bureau of Economic Research which ranks highly among The Most Influential Think Tanks</p1>
