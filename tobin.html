James Tobin is the most prominent American Keynesian, not only because he refused to join the mass conversion to the monetarist faith, but also because he consistently defended his conviction that the original Keynesian theory of determining national income can be expanded and updated in such a way that it is useful to address the macroeconomic problems of the 1980s and 90s.
His groundbreaking theoretical work on the percentage-sensitive demand for money, his empirical studies of consumption and savings, his analysis of the influence of financial variables on spending decisions, his efforts to embed money and business cycles in economic growth models, his sharp criticism of the theoretical basis of monetarism Milton Friedman and his defense of demand management, contrary to the views of the proponents of the "new classical macroeconomics", earned him the 1981 Nobel Prize.

<h1 style='color:White' align="center"> Tobin tax </h1>
Among the general public, Tobin became famous for his proposal, made back in the early 1970s, that if a tax on foreign exchange transactions were introduced, then even if it were only 0.1% -0.25%, this could sharply limit cross-border currency speculation, making most of them unprofitable and reducing their harm, especially for developing countries.
According to Tobin, this tax would bring in at least $ 150 billion a year, which he proposed to be divided between the International Monetary Fund and national banks. 
As a result of the European debt crisis, the EU began to look for additional sources of income, and as one of them, France and Germany are proposing the Tobin tax in a broad sense as a tax on financial transactions. This bill met with resistance from the UK, whose prime minister threatened to veto it .
